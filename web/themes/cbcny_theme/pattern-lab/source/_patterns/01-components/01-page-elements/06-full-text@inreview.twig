<h2>New York State’s Tax Base: Increasingly Reliant on Volatile Personal Income Taxes</h2>
<p>New York State’s tax revenues come from the personal income tax (PIT), sales and use taxes, business and corporate taxes, and some other smaller taxes; in 2016, these taxes totaled $74.7 billion. The majority of tax revenues – more than 60 percent – come from the PIT, and the State’s reliance on PIT revenues has increased over time, growing from 54 percent of tax revenues in 1986 to 63 percent in 2016 (See Figure 1).</p>
<p>As the State’s reliance on PIT revenues has grown, so has the percentage of PIT revenues that are paid by the highest earners, making the PIT a particularly volatile source of revenue. Between 2002 and 2015, the contribution from the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased from 32.2 percent to 41.5 percent.[3] Similarly, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) in excess of $1 million accounted for only 0.6 percent of filers but 27 percent of AGI and 40.2 percent of PIT liability in 2016.[4] This is important because higher income individuals typically have more capital gains, which are prone to greater fluctuations than other types of income. In 2011, the most recent year for which detailed information is available, net capital gains were 7.4 percent of total income for all taxpayers combined, but 46.2 percent of income for taxpayers with more than $10 million in AGI.[5] Since 2001, net capital gains annual growth rates in New York State have ranged widely, from positive growth of 73.8 percent in calendar year 2004 to a decline of 54.1 percent in 2008.[6] In the three-year period covering calendar years 2007, 2008, and 2009, net capital gains decreased from $116.4 billion to $29.7 billion.[7] Assuming the current top tax rate of 8.82 percent, a decline in capital gains of this magnitude would have a revenue impact of almost $7.7 billion per year.</p>
