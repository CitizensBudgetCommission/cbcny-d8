/**
 * Fast 404 settings:

 *
 * The first is to check for URLs which appear to be files or images. If Drupal
 * is handling these items, then they were not found in the file system and are
 * a 404.
 *
 * The second is to check whether or not the URL exists in Drupal by checking
 * with the menu router, aliases and redirects. If the page does not exist, we
 * will server a fast 404 error and exit.
